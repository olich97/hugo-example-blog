# Hugo Example Blog

This repository offers an example site for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and also it provides the default content for demos hosted on the [Hugo Themes Showcase](https://themes.gohugo.io/).

It is used as an example for first blog post: [Building a personal blog with Hugo and Vercel](https://olich.me/post/building-a-personal-blog-with-hugo-and-vercel/)

# Content

Under `/content/` this repository contains the following:

- A section called `/post/` with sample markdown content
- A headless bundle called `homepage` that you may want to use for single page applications. You can find instructions about headless bundles over [here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#headless-bundle)
- An `about.md` that is intended to provide the `/about/` page for a theme demo

If you intend to build a theme that does not fit in the content structure provided in this repository, then you are still more than welcome to submit it for review at the [Hugo Themes](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/issues) repository.
